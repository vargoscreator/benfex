                                        <p class="faqPage__block-descr">This procedure confirms the absolute legality of your transaction before regulatory authorities.

                                        <p class="faqPage__block-descr">Benfex's AML/KYC procedure is supported by an automated risk prevention system. If a transaction is flagged as suspicious by this system, the exchange is paused, and the corresponding client is asked to confirm their identity.</p>
                                        <p class="faqPage__block-descr">The system uses specific criteria; however, they cannot be disclosed, as revealing them may lead to attempts to abuse these criteria to deceive the algorithm.</p>
                                        <p class="faqPage__block-descr">This system has proven effective against money launderers and fraudsters, as the KYC process allows us to quickly and seamlessly distinguish an honest client from a fraudster.</p>
                                        <p class="faqPage__block-descr">Each KYC case is processed individually. If a specific client is eligible for the procedure because their transaction has been flagged as suspicious, they are informed through a pop-up notification after submitting the exchange, asking them to contact customer support.</p>
                                        <p class="faqPage__block-descr">We do everything within our power to maintain our reputation as a legitimate, law-abiding exchange service that is safe for anyone to use, whether an ordinary person with minimal involvement in cryptocurrency or an experienced trader or miner. Therefore, Benfex reserves the right to apply the KYC/AML procedure to specific clients, wallet addresses, and selected assets.</p>
                                        <p class="faqPage__block-descr">Benfex does not support money laundering or other illegal activities. Therefore, the service does not enter into any business agreements with individuals or entities involved or suspected of being involved in such activities.</p>

Libertad then reserves the right to blacklist this address (or addresses), making it (or them) ineligible for making deposits on the service.</p>
